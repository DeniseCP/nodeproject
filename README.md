# Node Project

Welcome to my Node.js project, which is based on the fantastic [Node.js & Express From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYRpji8t4SxUkMxfowG4Kqp) series.

## Overview

This Node.js application is designed with user-friendliness in mind, using Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. Its primary purpose is to showcase my proficiency in Node.js and Express.js while demonstrating my adaptability to different programming languages and my ability to swiftly address version changes. For instance, while the tutorial used Mongoose version 4.10.2, I have upgraded to the latest version as of August 2023, which is 7.4.5.

The application offers essential features, including CRUD operations, user authentication, robust form validation, and meticulous access control and verification.
